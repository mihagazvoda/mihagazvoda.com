My name is Miha Gazvoda and I work as a data scientist at [Outfit7](https://outfit7.com/) (Ekipa2 d.o.o. subsidiary) in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I love outdoor sports - cycling is my favorite. During my early student years, I was a semi-professional poker player and won a Slovenian poker championship (team event) in 2014. I can't say no to a non-fiction book that arouses my curiosity. And I can't say no to an excuse not to write. I'm trying to fix that - right here, right now.

This blog is a collection of my data science side projects, topics that interest me, and personal stories I want to share. It's built with [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).  My logo (on upper-left corner) was created by [Jovana Đukić](https://www.jovanadukic.com).
