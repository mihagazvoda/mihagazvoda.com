This weekend I solved the Jenga problem from [The Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/). In this post, I describe my solution. But first, the riddle:

> In the game of Jenga, you build a tower and then remove its blocks, one at a time, until the tower collapses. But in Riddler Jenga, you start with one block and then place more blocks on top of it, one at a time. 
>
> All the blocks have the same alignment (e.g., east-west). Importantly, whenever you place a block, its center is picked randomly along the block directly beneath it.  
>
> On average, how many blocks must you place so that your tower collapses â€” that is, until at least one block falls off?

For additional explanation, [visit Riddler's official page](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-win-riddler-jenga/).

# Why does the tower collapse? 

Let's say we have the Jenga tower (as on the sketch) and want to calculate whether it's stable.

![The Jenga tower with marked forces of gravity on blocks' centers and potential axes of rotation.](../../images/jenga/jenga_tower.png)

When the tower is stable, sum of forces and torques acting on it equals zero:
$$
\sum F_i = 0  
$$
$$
\sum \tau_i = 0
$$

The tower collapses when one of these equations is not fulfilled. Forces are not problematic: only forces of gravity act on the blocks (you can see them on the sketch) in their centers. But they get neutralized by the opposite force of the blocks below and table.

The collapsing Jenga tower *rotates*, not drops. The problem is imbalanced torque. Potential axes of rotations are edges pf the blocks.^[It could also be the block's center but you need huge force/torque to break the block.] They are marked with $\times$ on the sketch. The sum of torques has to be 0 for each of these axes. Torque is defined as:
$$
\tau = F \cdot r \cdot sin\theta
$$
where $\tau$ is torque, $r$ moment arm, $F$ applied force, and $\theta$  the angle between the force vector and the lever arm vector.^[Note that a $\tau$, $F$, and $r$ are in reality vectors bet here we are interested only in their magnitudes.] 

![The sketch represents the door from above and torque applied to the door hinges when someone wants to open the door.](../../images/jenga/door_torque.png)

To better understand torque, look at the sketch above. It represents the door from above. Someone wants to open them by applying force at the door handle. Torque is applied on the door hinges and can be calculated by the equation above.

In the same way we can calculate (sum of) torques on all blocks' edges. The situation is even simpler: we only care that the gravity center of any block (or multiple blocks together) is on lateral side (farther from the tower's center) compared to the edge of some brick (potential axis of rotation). This torque can't be compensated (there's nothing on the other side, just air resistance) so the tower collapses. 

On the Jenga tower sketch, circled $\times$ marks the axis around which the tower rotates when collapses. The center of gravity of the top 2 blocks is more to the left compared to the axis of rotation.

# Enough theory, let's code

We assume each block has uniformly distributed mass and it's 1 unit long.  Each time we add block its center is picked randomly along the block beneath it. Function `calc_next_block_center` does that.

```{r}
calc_next_block_center <- function(previous_block_center) {
  previous_block_center + runif(n = 1, min = -0.5, max = 0.5)
}
```

The function `are_block_above_balanced` calculates whether are blocks above some block balanced. Condition for that is that position of their combined gravity forces are less than half a brick away from the center of the brick beneath them.

```{r}
are_blocks_above_balanced <- function(block_center, block_centers_above) {
  abs(block_center - mean(block_centers_above)) < 0.5
}
```

`get_all_possible_subtowers` can be best explained with an example. Let's say the tower has 5 blocks, 1 at the bottom, 5 at the top. The function returns subtowers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5], and [4, 5]. 

```{r}
get_all_possible_subtowers <- function(block_centers) {
    blocks_count <- length(block_centers)
    purrr::map(1:(blocks_count - 1), ~block_centers[.:blocks_count])
}
```

With `get_tower_top_level` we are measuring how many blocks (= levels) the tower consists of when collapses.  
We always start building the tower with a block that has center at position 0. Then we place the next block center using `calc_next_block_center`. By concatenating `block_center` and `next_block_center` we get new, updated tower. Possible subtowers are then splitted by the bottom block and the blocks above and passed to `are_blocks_above_balanced`. When this is not true anymore, while loop breaks and all blocks in the off-balanced tower are counted. 

```{r}
get_tower_top_level <- function(...) {
  block_centers <- c(0)
  is_tower_balanced <- TRUE

  while(is_tower_balanced) {
    next_block_center <- calc_next_block_center(tail(block_centers, n = 1))

    block_centers <- c(block_centers, next_block_center)

    subtowers <- get_all_possible_subtowers(block_centers)
    
    is_tower_balanced <- all(purrr::map(
      subtowers, 
      ~are_blocks_above_balanced(.[1], .[-1])
    ))
  }

  length(block_centers)
}
```

Then we just simulate building of thousands of Jenga towers and calculate mean number of blocks in the collapsed towers.

```{r}
tower_heights <- purrr::map_int(1:1e3, get_tower_top_level)

mean(tower_heights)
```

We can plot the distribution:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(
  data.frame(tower_height = tower_heights), 
  aes(x = tower_height, y = ..prop..)
) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of number of blocks in the collapsed towers",
    y = "p",
    x = "Number of blocks"
  )
```

Now, let me rest my brain (but not nerves) by playing Jenga.
