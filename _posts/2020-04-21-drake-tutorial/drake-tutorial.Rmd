# Why is it useful
[`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) is an R package that analyzes your workflow. This enables to skip steps of the analysis with up-to-date results and provides evidence that results match the underlying code and data.

<!-- TODO include image that: X 1. Launch the code. 2. Wait while it runs. 3. Discover an issue. 4. Restart from scratch. -->

# Start

  
- basic commands  
- folder structure  
- minimal example  
- further reading  

Here are the most important ones.
```
    drake_plan(): create a workflow data frame (like my_plan).
    make(): build your project.
    drake_history(): show what you built, when you built it, and the function arguments you used.
    loadd(): load one or more built targets into your R session.
    readd(): read and return a built target.
    vis_drake_graph(): show an interactive visual network representation of your workflow.
    outdated(): see which targets will be built in the next make().
    deps_code(): check the dependencies of a command or function.
    drake_failed(): list the targets that failed to build in the last make().
    diagnose(): return the full context of a build, including errors, warnings, and messages.
```
